# Mushroom-Classification-Naive-Baye-s-
In this project I selected a Mushroom Dataset in which there are two classes of mushroom with each of different 23 feature values and using Naive Baye's classifier which uses Baye's theorem as an ideal, i am going to classify given any test case of a new mushroom belonging to which class.
